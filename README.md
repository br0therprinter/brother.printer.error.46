**Brother Printer error 46** is one of the most common issues in Brother Printer.  It occurs when your ink absorber is full. Ink absorber is a sponge-like pad which soaks excess ink. But sometimes your printer may display this error even when the ink absorber is not full. By using the purge counter the printer tries to decide whether the ink absorber is full or not. Sometimes, it might not decide correctly and flash the error 46. To resolve this issue you need to reset purge counter. Brother printer customer support is here to help you with this issue. Just follow the steps given below to troubleshoot the issue.
